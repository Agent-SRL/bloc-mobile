# bloc-mobile
Android app for blocgame.com

The mobile site is pretty good for larger screens like tablets but suffers on my phone, so I am working on a mobile app.

Help with the code (especially design/layout stuff) would be very appreciated, or feel free to just grab the APK from ./app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk

CURRENT FEATURES:

	* View budget, resources, army stats for your own nation
	* Domestic policies
	* Military policies
	* Show or hide policies through the settings menu
	* Market page
	* Read and reply to communiques

TO DO SOON:

	* Better (i.e. some) HTTP error handling
	* Search for/view other nations
	* Send comms to any player (i.e. not just replies)
	* Alliance chat

TO DO LATER:

	* Non-poverty aesthetics
	* War
